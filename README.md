# Layout-maker-Blarg-port

The layout maker from ABXD, ported to blargboard 1.2.4 MRS (it should work on blargboard 1.2 and forks if the plugin system isn't changed)

This is a slightly updated version of the layout maker from ABXD. since its made for blargboard, there is a huge notice on the main page about turning on a certain setting on your profile.

Instead of writing the css to a style sheet and linking it, this writes it ti the post layout header. My devboard just would not make the folder for it, so this is my solution. It works so im not complaining.

Do note that they layouts might not look 100% like their ABXD counterpart, but most look like them enough to pass.

The glowing layout has had its css moved too markup A, so it is in the header part. This is so then it's preview displays in layoutmaker2.

The plugin was tested with rewritten URLs, but untested with non rewritten URLs, so I dunno if it works on them.

Ive made some more templates, but im not uploading those now.

oh well. If there are any issues please file an issue. Thanks
